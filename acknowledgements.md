# Acknowledgements

This course created and taught by [Dr. Scott Smith](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/) for many years. [This was his website for the course as of the last time he taught it, in 2018](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose/index.shtml). Of course, that was the primary inspiration for the website you’re reading now.

One of Dr. Scott’s students, [Dr. Zachary Palmer](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/), taught in 2017 at Swarthmore College a [similar course](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/cs71/f17/), from which we also borrowed.

We also thank [Dr. Joanne Selinski](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~joanne/) for her help hiring the staff.
