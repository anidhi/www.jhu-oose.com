# Assignment 0: Project Proposal

# Onboarding

**Welcome to OOSE!**

One of the points of this course is that we aren‚Äôt using only pedagogical tools, but tools actually used by software engineers. To bring this point home, we run the course similar to how a software project is run, using the tools that software engineers use to coordinate their work. You‚Äôll use [GitHub](https://github.com) throughout the course to submit assignments, ask questions, collaborate with the other members of your group in the [group projects](/group-projects), and so forth. If you don‚Äôt have a GitHub account, [create one now](https://github.com/join). Then register for the course using the form below:

</small>

<button>Register</button>

</fieldset>
</form>

If you run into problems, send an email to <student-registration@jhu-oose.com>. Include all the information from the form above.

After you register, you are invited via email to the GitHub organization for the course, [`jhu-oose`](https://github.com/jhu-oose), joining the team `jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-students`, which grants you access to the [Students Area](https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-students){:data-proofer-ignore="true"}¬†<small title="You must a student logged into GitHub to see this.">üîí</small>, where you may find a public forum (visible only to other students in the course), announcements, videos of the lectures, and so forth.

After you register, you are also invited via email to a repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`. This is your individual repository in which you‚Äôll submit the [assignments](/#individual-assignments), receive grades, ask questions visible only to the staff, and so forth.

## Profile

<small>
**10 points**
</small>

<small>
Submit your profile as a [Markdown](/toolbox#authoring-language-markdown) document at `README.md` in the `master` branch of your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.
</small>

Fill in the template below (parts marked with `<!-- -->` are placeholders that you must fill in):

```
# <!-- Name -->

![Profile Picture](<!-- Show your face, because the purpose of the profile picture is to be able to recognize you, see for example the pictures at https://www.jhu-oose.com/staff -->)

**Personal Pronoun (Optional):** <!-- See https://www.mypronouns.org to understand more about this question. Answer (if you wish) in the form of a link, for example, [She/her](https://www.mypronouns.org/she-her) -->

# Background

<!-- Are you fresh out of a data structures course? Do you have years of experience in industry? What technologies do you usually work with? What are your interests? And anything else you want to share. -->

# Expectations

<!-- Why did you sign up for the course? What do you expect to learn? And anything else you want to share. -->
```

# Project Ideas

<small>
Submit your project ideas (as well as all the rest below) as a [Markdown](/toolbox#authoring-language-markdown) document at `assignments/0.md` in the `master` branch of your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.
</small>

<small>
**15 points**
</small>

Come up with at least 3 [project ideas](/lectures/0#project-ideas). They may be silly‚Äîin fact, it may be better if they are.

# Project Proposal

<small>
**50 points**
</small>

Choose one of your [project ideas](#project-ideas) and develop it into a [project proposal](/iterations/0#project-proposal). Your project proposal doesn‚Äôt have to be fully developed, but you definitely need more than something at level of [the sample project proposal we did in Lecture¬†0](/lectures/0#the-project-proposal-we-wrote-together-in-class). Also, you must acknowledge the parts that are missing by saying, for example, ‚ÄúMy project requires integration with the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), but I don‚Äôt know yet if it has all the features I need‚Äîfurther study required.‚Äù

Your goal is to have something solid enough to discuss with your group members when you start working on your [group project](/group-projects).

# Software Engineering

<small>
**10 points**
</small>

We didn‚Äôt have the time to cover this in class, but see [the corresponding lecture notes](/lectures/0#welcome-to-oose)

Answer the following questions:

1. Do you see software engineering as a science or an art? Or a mix of both? If so, to what degree?

2. What makes a software engineer? Do you feel you are a software engineer?

# Technology

<small>
**15 points**
</small>

<video src="https://archive.org/download/todoose/todoose--getting-started.mp4" controls preload="none"></video>

1. Go through the tools in the [Toolbox](/toolbox) and install them.

2. Visit [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose) and play with the [live version](https://todoose.herokuapp.com){:data-proofer-ignore="true"} to learn how the application works (it‚Äôs a simple to-do application).

3. Import TODOOSE as a project in [IntelliJ¬†IDEA](/toolbox#integrated-development-environmentide-intellijidea).

4. Run the server.

5. Interact with the application locally in [Google Chrome](/toolbox#browser-googlechrome). **Take a screenshot of the application open locally in Google Chrome and include in your submission (for example, see the screenshot below).**

   ![Running locally in Google Chrome](running-locally-in-google-chrome.png)

6. Run the [JUnit](/toolbox#testing-framework-junit) tests in IntelliJ¬†IDEA. **Take a screenshot of the tests passing locally and include in your submission (for example, see the screenshot below).**

   ![JUnit tests](junit-tests.png)

7. Open the API specification in [Postman](/toolbox#application-programming-interfaceapi-development-environmentade-postman).

8. Run the Postman tests. **Take a screenshot of the tests passing and include in your submission (for example, see the screenshot below).**

   ![Postman tests](postman-tests.png)

9. See the [tests running](https://travis-ci.com/jhu-oose/todoose) on [Travis¬†CI](/toolbox#continuous-integrationci-server-travisci).

10. Deploy the application to [Heroku](/toolbox#platform-heroku) with the application name `todoose-<identifier>`. For example, if you were [`jhu-oose-example-student`](https://github.com/jhu-oose-example-student) on GitHub, then your application name would be `todoose-jhu-oose-example-student`. **We‚Äôll look at your deployed version when grading, so make sure you get the name right and don‚Äôt remove the application from Heroku until after you received your grade.**

11. Start watching the [video series showing us buidling TODOOSE](/todoose). You have about one month before we‚Äôll dive deeper into the implementation, and by then you must have a fair understanding of the technology. One or two videos every day will get you there.

# Submission

**‚ö†Ô∏è¬†¬†Your assignment is submitted only when you submit the form below.**

First, push your assignment to your individual repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`. Make sure you follow the naming conventions established in this page, for example, your [profile](#profile) must go in `README.md` and the rest of the answers must go in `assignments/0.md`. [Our robot](/staff#robot--roboose) already put starter files in place for you.

After your assignment is pushed, you must submit the form below.

Submissions are final. You may only submit this form once, but you may push to your individual repository however many times you want.

The time of the submission, which we use to calculate [late days](/policies#late-submissions), is the time when you submit this form, _not the time of the commit you‚Äôre submitting_.
