# Assignment 5: Implementation · Client

Since [Lecture 4](/lectures/4) we’re implementing a new feature in [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/): the ability to see items that were marked as completed, as opposed to just removing them from the list forever.

For this assignment you must complete the implementation. The parts you need to work on are in the tests and the client.

Watch the [video of the lecture](/lectures/5). Go through the [Issue](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/issues/24), its corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25), and the [project board](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/projects/3) (look at Iteration 4). Go through the code base on the [`show-completed` branch](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/tree/show-completed), which contains `TODO` comments you must fill in.

Here’s a video on how to setup to work on this assignment.

Here’s a checklist of the specific things you need to do:

- [Fix the compilation error in the JUnit test](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/test/java/com/jhuoose/todoose/models/ItemTests.java#L11).
- [Add the new JUnit test we discussed in lecture](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/test/java/com/jhuoose/todoose/models/ItemTests.java#L18).
- [Fix the Postman test for the “Get TODO items” request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/docs/TODOOSE.postman_collection.json#L24).
- [Fix the pre-request script for the “Mark items as incomplete” request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/docs/TODOOSE.postman_collection.json#L323-L326). **Extra Hint:** You can see how the `formdata` mode is used in the [JSON generated by Postman when exporting a collection](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/docs/TODOOSE.postman_collection.json#L253-L262).
- Fix the tests in [“Mark item as done”](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/docs/TODOOSE.postman_collection.json#L189) and [“Mark items as incomplete”](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/docs/TODOOSE.postman_collection.json#L306). They’re still using the `DELETE` HTTP method and they aren’t passing the `formdata` with `completed=false/true` as they should. The tests are only passing because the server doesn’t know about a request with the `DELETE` method, so it’s sending a 404, which is the default. **This is something we didn’t catch in lecture and there’s no TODO comment for it in the code base.**
- Address the TODOs in `ItemsComponents.js` to make the `Show Completed`/`Hide Completed` button work: [part 1](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L14-L15), [part 2](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L29-L30), [part 3](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L56-L57), [part 4](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L31-L32), [part 5](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L58-L59), and [part 6](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/573ef0a5a2878c85f23f630487966dcc614e1aa1/src/main/resources/public/javascripts/components/ItemsComponents.js#L44).
- Export the Postman collection, commit everything, and push to the `show-completed` branch of your repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/2019-student-<identifier>`.
- Observe that the tests (including the new tests you added) are passing on Travis CI at `https://travis-ci.com/jhu-oose/2019-student-<identifier>`.
- Deploy this new version to Heroku. **Use the Heroku application with an unpredictable name you created in [Assignment 4](/assignments/4); don’t reuse the Heroku application from [Assignment 0](/assignments/0).**
