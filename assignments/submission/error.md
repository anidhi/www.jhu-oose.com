# Assignment Submission

**Something went wrong trying to submit your assignment.**

Did you forget to push to your assignment to your individual repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`?

Did you try to submit a commit with just code for a coding assignment, as opposed to a complete submission with a filled in `assignments/<assignment>.md`?

Send an email to <assignment-submission@jhu-oose.com> including the information about the submission: your GitHub Identifier and the Commit Identifier. Don’t include any information about the feedback—it’s anonymous.
