# Course Assistant Candidates

Read the [Course Description](/course-description).

As a course assistant, you may choose on what you want to work. Here are the possibilities:

- Advise and evaluate the [group projects](/group-projects).
- Grade the [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments) and the [quiz](/quiz).
- Hold office hours.
- Prepare [lectures](/#lectures), [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments), and other [course material](/#course-material).

The time commitment varies a lot depending on what you choose to do. Typically, it’s 5–10 hours per week. If you advise group projects, you must attend the [laboratory sessions](/calendar), but otherwise the schedule is flexible.

You must learn the course material and the tools in the [Toolbox](/toolbox). That’s a responsibility, but it’s actually also one of the perks of the job, because we compensate you for the time that you spend learning. You may even go beyond the Toolbox and learn whatever other topics in which you may be interested, as long as it helps a group you’re advising, for example, a new web framework, or machine learning, and so forth.

The most important assets in a course assistant are:

- **Dependability:** You must be there for the students and complete your tasks on time.
- **Self-Motivation:** Most of the work is asynchronous and distributed, so you must be able to work on your own, though the rest of the course staff is here to help you with any difficulties you may have.
- **Willingness to Learn:** You must learn the tools and the parts of the material with which you’re less comfortable.

We give you the structure that you need to succeed, including instructions on how to grade assignments, help students during office hours, and so forth.
