# Course Description for Course Assistant Candidates

Object-Oriented Software Engineering (or as we like to call it, OOSE) is a course about good practices for building software. We teach design principles, design patterns, refactoring techniques, and so forth. We have written assignments covering these topics, and the centerpiece of the course is a semester-long group project in which they put the ideas in practice. To make the group project feasible, we also have to cover many software engineering tools, for example, Git, JavaScript, and so forth.

As a course assistant, you may choose what you want to do. Here are the possibilities:

- Hold office hours.
- Grade written assignments and the midterm.
- Advise and evaluate the semester-long group projects.
- Prepare lectures, assignments, and course material.

The time commitment varies a lot depending on what you choose to do. If you want to work with the group projects, you must attend to some laboratory sessions, but otherwise the schedule is flexible.

You’re expected to work independently and to collaborate asynchronously. You’ll have to learn the course material and [the tools](/toolbox) that we use.

You will receive instructions on how to grade assignments, help students during office hours, and so forth. We’ll give you the structure that you need to succeed.
