Course Description for Course Assistant Candidates
==================================================

Object-Oriented Software Engineering (or as we like to call it, OOSE) is a course about good practices for building software. We teach design principles, design patterns, refactoring techniques, and so forth. We have written assignments covering these topics, and the centerpiece of the course is a semester-long group project in which they put the ideas in practice. To make the group project feasible, we also have to cover many software engineering tools, for example, Git, JavaScript, and so forth.

Your Responsibilities
---------------------

You may choose what you want to do. Here are the possibilities:

- Hold office hours.
- Grade written assignments and the midterm.
- Advise and evaluate the semester-long group projects.
- Prepare lectures, assignments, and course material.

If you want to work with the group projects, you must attend to some laboratory sessions, otherwise the schedule is flexible.

You’re expected to work independently and collaborate asynchronously. You’ll have to learn some of the material and [the tools](/toolbox) that we use.

The time commitment varies a lot depending on what you choose to work on.

You will receive instructions on how to grade assignments, help students during office hours, and so forth. We’ll give you the structure you need to succeed.
