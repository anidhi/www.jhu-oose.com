# Group Projects

- Iterations are just that: there’ll be some of everything in every iteration, but iterations have a special focus. There will be some implementation in iteration 1 and some designing in iteration 6

# Examples

- semester.ly
- Previous Year’s Projects?

- Dr. Scott’s grad review system
- Joanne’s CA hiring process
- A micro social network for coffeeshops
- Double-entry bookkeeping, like GNUcash
- Something related to your research

# Laboratory Sessions

This is in-class time for you to work on your project, discuss your progress with your advisor, and so forth.

# Laboratory Session 1

Before the laboratory session, read the rest of this page to understand what you must submit for this iteration.

**If Your Group isn’t Formed:** This may be either because you’re not part of a group or because your group is looking for more members. Your main goal in this laboratory session is to form a group.

Go to our usual classroom and discuss [your project proposals](/assignments/0#project-proposal) with other students. Look for people with similar interests in terms of theme and technology, but with diverse backgrounds and levels of experience. A lot of what you’ll learn in this course won’t come from the staff, but from the other members of your group.

**If Your Group is Formed:** Go to the room assigned to your group, _not to our usual classroom_. Discuss [your project proposals](/assignments/0#project-proposal) with the other group members and the staff. Find a project that motivates your group and work with the staff to establish a balance in terms of difficulty. Work on the project proposal (or _proposals_, if you can’t decide on one yet) for your group.

# Laboratory Sessions 2 & 3

Before the laboratory sessions, read the rest of this page to understand what you must submit for this iteration.

Go to the room assigned to your group, which may not be our usual classroom. Discuss your project proposal with your advisor. Work on the tasks for this iteration and show your progress to your advisor.

# Laboratory Sessions 4–13

By this point in the project you’re working on the implementation. Read the page for the current iteration before the laboratory sessions to understand which stage we expect you project to reach.

Go to the room assigned to your group, which may not be our usual classroom. Discuss your project proposal with your advisor. Work on the tasks for this iteration and show your progress to your advisor.

# Presentations

There’ll be two presentations, one in the middle of the course, and one at the end.

- Demo
- Proposal
