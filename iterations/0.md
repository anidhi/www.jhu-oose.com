Group Identifier  
<input type="text" name="identifier" required pattern="[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-]*[A-Za-z0-9]">  
</label>
<small>
This must be a valid GitHub identifier: it may only contain alphanumeric characters or single hyphens, and cannot begin or end with a hyphen.  
Don‚Äôt include an `@` sign at the beginning‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a [mention](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams).  
You may choose an identifier related to your project if you already decided on a project; for example, if your project were [TODOOSE](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose) then your group identifier could be `todoose`. Or you may just choose a name for your group, for example, `power-oosers`.

<button>Register Group</button>

</fieldset>
</form>

When you register your group, the group members will be invited to a GitHub Team called `jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-group-<identifier>` and will be granted access to a repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-group-<identifier>`, which you will use for the rest of the course to submit iterations, receive reviews, communicate with your advisor, and so forth.

You group will be assigned a temporary advisor for now, and by the end of [Iteration 1](/iterations/1) you‚Äôll be assigned your definitive advisor.

# Project Proposal

At this point your group may not have decided on a project, especially if your group was formed during [Laboratory Session 1](#laboratory-session-1). In that case, you may submit not only one project proposal, but two or three of them. In [Iteration 1](/iterations/1) you‚Äôll decide which proposal to pursue with the help of your (temporary) group advisor.

Your group‚Äôs project proposal may be simply a more elaborated version of a project proposal from one your group members‚Äôs [Assignment 0](/assignments/0#project-proposal).

The project proposal must include the following:

- **Title:** If you already have a name for the project, then the title may be that name. If you don‚Äôt have a name for the project yet, then the title may be just a working title, for example, ‚ÄúProject GLaDOS.‚Äù

- **Elevator Pitch:** A brief description of what you‚Äôre proposing.

  These are the two or three sentences you‚Äôd use to describe your project to your advisor if you only had 30 seconds, for example, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre building a social network for weasel-owners for them to find weasel play-dates: it‚Äôs a web application that is like Tinder, but for weasels.‚Äù

- **Problem:** A more in-depth analysis of the problem your project is addressing.

  If you‚Äôre working in a domain that isn‚Äôt generally understood by a broader audience, then you must include an introduction to that domain. For example, if you‚Äôre working with finances and the stock market, then you must explain what are ticks, Exchange-Traded Funds¬†(ETFs), or whatever else may be relevant to your project.

- **Solution:** A more in-depth analysis of how your project is solving the problem introduced above, including the following:

  - **Architecture Overview:** Are you building a web application, a mobile application, a desktop application, a software library? Or maybe are you combining a few of them (for example, if your project is a marketplace then you could be developing a web application for customers and a desktop application for service providers)?

    Are you integrating with existing Application Programming Interfaces¬†(APIs) (for example, [GitHub‚Äôs API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)), sending and receiving emails as a primary feature in the application (not only for notifications, but for something more functional, for example, [Kill the Newsletter!](https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com)), and so forth?

  - **Features List:** A bullet-point list of the _nontrivial_ features of your application.

    Don‚Äôt include features like ‚Äúuser signup,‚Äù ‚Äúlogin,‚Äù ‚Äúcreate/read/update/delete cars from inventory,‚Äù and so forth. Think of the features list as something you could include in a marketing website; for example, see [GitHub‚Äôs features list](https://github.com/features).

  - **Wireframes:** Sketches of the user interface, including how information will be laid out and what will be the flows through the application.

    If you‚Äôre building a software library, which doesn‚Äôt include a visual component to it, replace wireframes with a sketch of the API that the library provides.

  - **User Stories:** If there are flows in the application that aren‚Äôt easily communicated with wireframes, then describe them as user stories.

    An user story usually starts with something like: ‚ÄúAs a \<kind-of-actor\>, I want to \<action\>, so that \<goal\>.‚Äù From there, the user story elaborates on _how_ the actor performs the action to achieve the goal, including what should happen when things go wrong.

    For example, if the application is a blog, then an user story could start with: ‚ÄúAs a comment moderator, I want to block users based on their region, so that their comments must be approved manually to reduce spam.‚Äù Then the user story would describe the steps to block users based on their region: draw a region on a map, or provide a zip code, and so forth. The user story should also describe what should happen if the region is too big, or if the zip code doesn‚Äôt exist, and so forth.

- **Feasibility Analysis:** Determine whether the project you‚Äôre proposing is even possible. Consider the following:

  - **Hardware:** If you‚Äôre building a mobile application, do all your group members have the necessary devices? Remember that to develop for iOS you also need Macs.

    If your project is related to the Internet of Things¬†(IoT), for example, can the devices do what you expect them to do?

  - **APIs:** If you‚Äôre planing on consuming some API: Does it have the data you need? Do you have access to it, or it behind a paywall?

  - **Tools:** If you need tools that aren‚Äôt in the [Toolbox](/toolbox): Do you have access to them, or are they paid? Can they do what you expect them to do? This is particularly important if your project depends heavily on third-party libraries, for example, if you‚Äôre working in the domain of computer vision, natural-language processing, machine learning, and so forth.

  - **Prototype:** If some of the above isn‚Äôt clear, build a quick prototype to demonstrate feasibility. For example, download and install the computer vision library you intend to use and show that it can find a face, or whatever else you need for your project.

- **Difficulty:** Determine whether the project you‚Äôre proposing satisfies the requirements for the course, including at least one non-trivial feature that goes beyond simple data manipulation.

  Your project must not be simply a _database on the web_, for example, a bulletin-board to post university-related events. Your project must be something you _couldn‚Äôt_ do with a simple shared spreadsheet. It must include some unique and interesting logic, so you get to practice important software engineering skills, as opposed to just gluing tools together.

  But at the same time your project must be completed over the course of one semester by 5 or 6 students who have other responsibilities in life.

  It‚Äôs always possible to make a project more interesting and elaborate by adding features, or to make a project simpler by removing features. You must talk to your advisor to find the right balance.

  Avoid vague features. For example, if you‚Äôre building a bulletin-board to post university-related events, you may propose something like ‚Äúa recommendation system for events based on your interests.‚Äù Features like these are hard to pin down and do right.
