# Iteration 1: Design

**<small>🚧</small>  Work in Progress  <small>🚧</small>**

# Project Proposal Review

If you presented multiple proposals in [Iteration 0](/iterations/0), then you must decide on one now.

Discuss your proposal with your advisor. You may need to rework some parts, or scale the project up or down.

# Design

Present the design of your application as a [Markdown](/toolbox/#authoring-language-markdown) document at `docs/design.md` in your group’s repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-group-<identifier>`.

## Architecture

This is a more detailed version of the Architecture Overview you introduced as part of the [Solution in your Project Proposal](/iterations/0#solution).

If you’re using only the tools in the [Toolbox](/toolbox), then this section may the same as the Architecture Overview: “We’re using the tools in Toolbox.”

If you’re deviating from the Toolbox, then you must specify the components of your application, for example, a web application for system administrators, a mobile application for customers, an API for plugin developers, and so forth.

You must also specify which tools outside the Toolbox you’re using, including services, APIs, libraries, frameworks, and so forth. For example, if you need an email server, then you must specify which email server you’re using (either [Exim](https://www.exim.org), or [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org), and so forth). You must discuss what these tools are and why you chose them, similar to what we did when introducing the [Toolbox](/toolbox).
