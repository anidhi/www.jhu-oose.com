# Iteration 2: First Feature

**<small>ğŸš§</small>Â Â Work in ProgressÂ Â <small>ğŸš§</small>**

You must update the project board throughout the course to keep track of your progress.

To begin working on a feature, convert the corresponding note into a [GitHubÂ Issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues), assign the issue to the group members who are responsible for the feature, and break it apart in smaller tasks.

You may move notes around when the plan changes. When youâ€™re done working on the feature, create a [GitHubÂ PullÂ Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) associated with the issue, merge it, and close the issue.
