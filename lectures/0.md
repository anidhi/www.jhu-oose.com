# Lecture 0: Project Proposal

# Welcome

- You’re already a software engineer. The purpose of this course is to make you a better one.
- The industry needs the freshness of the new and inexperienced
- What is software engineering, science or art? It’s an exercise in empathy!
- OOSE is actually three courses:
  - Ideas (Lectures): The things that last
  - Technology (Online): The things that change
  - Practice (Labs): Only way to learn the other two
- My goal is to elevate the level of discourse (from syntax to ideas)
- Give the language to communicate (and therefore, to experience and appreciate) ideas about software

# Project Ideas

- Where do ideas come from?
  - Scratching your own itch
  - Research
  - A TV show
  - Something someone said on Reddit
- Silly ideas may be better than serious ones, because they don’t cause paralysis
- Weather from years ago
- Twitter
- Bluetooth mug

# Project Proposal

- Idea & Product Discovery
- Waterfall vs. Scrum vs. Lean and so forth
- Assignment: find products on hackernews, product hunt & reddit. Critique their feature lists & use cases (not market pages) (or maybe find them in the Toolbox?)
- User stories vs use cases
- Choosing tools

# Logistics

- Website & calendar & so forth
- Assignment 0 & Iteration 0
- Start watching the TODOOSE video series if you’re unfamiliar with the Toolbox
