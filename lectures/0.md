# Lecture 0: Project Proposal

# Project Ideas

- It all starts with a great idea, right?
  - I don’t think so: Silly ideas may be better than great ones, because they don’t cause paralysis.
- Real-world silly ideas:
  - [A blog, except your posts are limited to 140 characters](https://twitter.com).
  - [A smart mug](https://ember.com).
  - [A Wi-Fi connected juicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juicero).
- Some of my silly ideas:
  - A weather application that shows the weather from years ago.
  - Google Docs, but for writing lyrics for songs, helping with rhymes, rhythm, and so forth.
- Where do ideas come from?
  - Scratching your own itch.
  - Something someone said on a TV show, or Reddit, and so forth.
  - A remix of existing ideas.
- Come up with your own silly ideas.

# Welcome to OOSE

- Software Engineering: Science or art?
  - For me, a mix of both, but mostly an art: an exercise in empathy.
- Software Engineer: What makes one?
  - For me, writing code: you’re a software engineer already.
  - The industry needs new people.
- Goals?
  - Make you a more confident software engineer.
  - Give the language to communicate ideas about software.
    - Allow you to _think_ those ideas.
