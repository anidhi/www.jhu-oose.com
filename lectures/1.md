# Class Diagrams

- Come up with features for TODOOSE:
  - Different kinds of users, for example, project manager, software developer, and so forth.
- When we talk about _design_ we donâ€™t mean _graphic design_.
- Can we start writing code already?
  - Yes:
    - Diagrams may merely document existing code.
    - Thatâ€™s what happened with TODOOSE: we started with code, and now we can reflect on what we did and draw diagrams about it.
    - Diagrams are just a different perspective, and it may give you new insight.
  - No:
    - Complex systems.
    - Youâ€™re architecting something for other people to build, for example, a plugin system (diagrams may be part of the documentation for plugin developers), or a network protocol (diagrams may help you communicate with browser developers), and so forth.
- Levels of abstraction:
  - Depends on your audience, and what you want to communicate.
  - Some diagrams correspond one-to-one with code.
  - Some diagrams are open to interpretation and only convey high-level ideas.
- Start with low-level:
  - `Item` from TODOOSE.
