# Lecture 3: Design Patterns

**ðŸš§Â Â Work in ProgressÂ Â ðŸš§**

- Identify design patterns in libraries and tools that theyâ€™re using (the ones in the Toolbox)
- Example of the adapter pattern in TODOOSE: supporting SQLite and PostgreSQL
- MVC
  - Many different interpretations (original from Xerox paper, Rails, JavaScript front-end frameworks)
  - In TODOOSE, the server and the client are two different MVC stacksâ€”they arenâ€™t one application, but two applications communicating over the network (a distributed application)
  - The server and the client use MVC differently
  - In the server we donâ€™t have a proper V layer: itâ€™s mostly just rendering JSON
  - We could need a V layer if we were to render JSON that doesnâ€™t map one-to-one with our models
  - We have a layer that isnâ€™t in MVC, the **repository**
  - In the client we donâ€™t have the M and the C layers: the Mâ€™s arenâ€™t necessary because the whole logic lives on the server, and the C would be so thin that they wouldnâ€™t be worth the abstraction
  - This could change if the client had more responsibilities
  - The client could even have a **repository** of sorts, whose responsibility would be to communicate with the server
