# Lecture 5: Implementation · Client

- We’re continuing the implementation of the feature from [Lecture 4](/lectures/4).
- Now we’re working on the tests and the client.
- See the [Issue](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/issues/24), its corresponding [Pull Request](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/pull/25), and the [project board](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/projects/3) (look at Iteration 4).

# Tests

- We’re covering three kinds of tests:
  1. JUnit tests.
     - For the _models_. The **M** in MVC. The things you include in a class diagram.
  2. Postman tests.
     - For the whole server. Postman pretends to be a browser and acts as the client. This exercises the router, the controllers, the repositories, the database, and so forth.
  3. Manual tests on the browser.
     - This tests the client.
- Automated tests are like an autograder that you wish you had for [Assignment 4](/assignments/4).
- There are many more kinds of tests that we aren’t covering, for example, there are ways to test the client without having to open the browser and click around.

# Client

- See the [wireframe](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/46d406a0a4246f77a615e5ae939b4a6de25d2095/docs/wireframes.jpeg).
- We cover the most important aspects of React:
  - Defining components as functions or classes.
  - Using components with JSX.
  - Moving back and forth between JavaScript and what looks like HTML in JSX (but actually are function calls).
  - Props.
  - State.
  - Event handlers.
