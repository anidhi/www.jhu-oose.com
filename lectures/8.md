  - Donâ€™t overtest
  - Code coverage
  - When to write tests (with client, before coding, after coding)
  - Order-independence
  - UI Testing (snapshoting)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Different kinds of users, for example, project manager, software developer, and so forth. What if someone can be perform multiple roles? Authorization.
