- What are some examples of programming paradigms?

- Is Java object-oriented, or functional? Why? What about JavaScript?

- Why are most mainstream programming languages multi-paradigm?

# Object-Oriented vs. Functional Programming

Here are two snippets of JavaScript implementing the same behavior:

<figure markdown="1">

```javascript
class Rock {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors;
  }
}

class Paper {
  toString() {
    return "üìÑ";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Rock;
  }
}

class Scissors {
  toString() {
    return "‚úÇÔ∏è";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Paper;
  }
}

const player1Choice = new Rock();
const player2Choice = new Scissors();

console.log(`Player 1 chose ${player1Choice}`);
console.log(`Player 2 chose ${player2Choice}`);
if (player1Choice.beats(player2Choice)) console.log("Player 1 wins!");
else if (player2Choice.beats(player1Choice)) console.log("Player 2 wins!");
else console.log("It‚Äôs a draw!");
```

```

- What is this code doing?

- How are the two versions different? How did we go from one to the other?

- Which version is written in an object-oriented style and which is written in a functional style? Why?

- Which parts of which version are better? Why?

- How can we combine these versions to have the best of both worlds?

- Suppose that we want to extend the game with `Lizard` and `Spock`. Is it better to do that in an object-oriented or in a functional style?

- Suppose that we want to extend the game with a feature to randomly choose an option for the player. Is it better to do that in an object-oriented or in a functional style?

## Key Points

**Object-Oriented Programming**

- It couples the kinds of data with the actions you can perform on them, but breaks apart the parts of the actions.

- It‚Äôs good for when you want to be able to come up with new kinds of data.

- It isn‚Äôt as good for when you want to come up with new actions on the data.

- The canonical use case for object-oriented programming is building user interfaces. That‚Äôs because we commonly want to change what components are part of the interface, but we rarely want to assign them new actions. For example, we may want add or remove a button from the interface, but we rarely want to change the kinds of actions a button supports‚Äîit can be clicked, hovered, and so forth, but that‚Äôs it.

**Funcional Programming**

- It decouples the kinds of data from the actions you can perform on them, but keeps the parts of the actions in one place.

- It isn‚Äôt good for when you want to be able to come up with new kinds of data.

- It‚Äôs as good for when you want to come up with new actions on the data.

- The canonical use case for functional programming is manipulating mathematical equations. You rarely want to change the kinds of equations your program can handle, because it‚Äôs rare that someone comes up with a new kind of operator or a new kind of number. But you commonly want to add new actions on those equations: finding the solution for a given variable, taking the derivative, and so forth.

# Object-Oriented Programming in Depth

Typically people learn about object orientation in languages like Java, but there‚Äôs a lot more to it in other languages. We‚Äôll continue to use JavaScript in this section, but many ideas here apply to other languages like Ruby, Python, Scala, and so forth.

## Duck Typing

Consider our extension for choosing an option randomly:

```javascript
class Rock {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors;
  }
}

class Paper {
  toString() {
    return "üìÑ";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Rock;
  }
}

class Scissors {
  toString() {
    return "‚úÇÔ∏è";
  }

  beats(otherPlayerChoice) {
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Paper;
  }
}

function randomChoice() {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  if (randomNumber < 1 / 3) return new Rock();
  if (randomNumber < 2 / 3) return new Paper();
  if (randomNumber < 3 / 3) return new Scissors();
}

const player1Choice = randomChoice();
const player2Choice = randomChoice();

console.log(`Player 1 chose ${player1Choice}`);
console.log(`Player 2 chose ${player2Choice}`);
if (player1Choice.beats(player2Choice)) console.log("Player 1 wins!");
else if (player2Choice.beats(player1Choice)) console.log("Player 2 wins!");
else console.log("It‚Äôs a draw!");
```

- If this were written in Java, what could be the type of `player1Choice`?

- How would this type affect the _uses_ of `player1Choice`, for example, in `player1Choice.beats(player2Choice)`?

- Why isn‚Äôt this a problem in JavaScript?

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of duck typing?

## Monkey Patching

For example:

```javascript
class Rock {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }
}

const rock = new Rock();

Rock.prototype.toAscii = function() {
  return "rock";
};

rock.toString = function() {
  return "üêí";
};

console.log(`This ${rock.toAscii()}s!`);
console.log(`This ${rock}s!?`);
```

And:

```javascript
Array.prototype.sample = function() {
  return this[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.length)];
};

console.log(["üíé", "üìÑ", "‚úÇÔ∏è"].sample());
```

- Why would you want to monkey patch something?

- Why is it better to avoid monkey patching?

## Objects That Aren‚Äôt Instances of Classes

For example:

```javascript
const rock = {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }
};

console.log(`This ${rock}s!`);
```

- How would you build something equivalent to this in Java?

- Why would you want an object like this?

## A Class is Just a Function That Constructs an Object

For example:

```javascript
function Rock() {
  return {
    toString() {
      return "üíé";
    }
  };
}

console.log(`This ${Rock()}s!`);
```

- The `Rock()` function acts as the constructor of the `Rock` class we had in the first snippet on this page.

- Why would you write code like this?

## Classes are Values (Because They Really Are Just Functions, and Functions Are Values)

For example:

```javascript
class Rock {}
class Paper {}
class Scissors {}

function randomChoice() {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  let ClassToInstantiate;
  if (randomNumber < 1 / 3) ClassToInstantiate = Rock;
  else if (randomNumber < 2 / 3) ClassToInstantiate = Paper;
  else if (randomNumber < 3 / 3) ClassToInstantiate = Scissors;
  return new ClassToInstantiate();
}

const player1Choice = randomChoice();
```

## Mixins

For example:

```javascript
class Rock {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }
}

function toDoubleStringMixin(Base) {
  return class extends Base {
    toDoubleString() {
      return `${this}${this}`;
    }
  };
}

const DoubleRock = toDoubleStringMixin(Rock);

const player1Choice = new DoubleRock();

console.log(player1Choice.toDoubleString());
```

- Don‚Äôt get _mixed up_: If you look for mixins in JavaScript on the web, you‚Äôll find two different explanations. We‚Äôre going for the one you find at the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Mix-ins), not [the one using `Object.assign()`](https://javascript.info/mixins). Confusingly enough, in the React community [mixins take this latter meaning](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html), and what we‚Äôre calling mixins they call [higher-order components (HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

- Why is multiple inheritance disallowed in most programming languages?

- How do mixins solve this problem?

- A mixin is like an _abstract subclass_, as opposed to an _abstract superclass_ like those we have in Java. It‚Äôs as if we had written `abstract toString()` in the class returned by `toDoubleStringMixin()`.

- Mixins allow us to simulate multiple inheritance, just use something like `myOtherMixin(toDoubleStringMixin(Rock))`.

- Mixins allows us to exercise one of the most important principles of object-oriented programming: favor composition over inheritance ([here‚Äôs React‚Äôs take on this principle](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html), which is a really good explanation).

## Classes Don‚Äôt Have Parents; Objects Have Prototypes

<small>
We didn‚Äôt cover this in lecture.
</small>

```javascript
class Rock {
  toString() {
    return "üíé";
  }
}

class Paper {
  toString() {
    return "üìÑ";
  }
}

const rock = new Rock();
rock.__proto__ = Paper.prototype;

console.log(`This ${rock}s!?`);
```

- This is the so-called prototype-based inheritance system in JavaScript.

- Check these articles at the MDN: [Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) and [Inheritance in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance).

# Functional Programming in Depth

<small>
We didn‚Äôt cover this in lecture.
</small>

## Functions Are Values

- The so-called _higher-order functions_, or _lambdas_.

- Where did we use functions as values? In Java? In JavaScript?

## Favor Immutability

- In JavaScript, that is favor `const` instead of `let`. In Java, pretend variables are `final`.

- Also, use immutable data structures and functional updates, for example:

  ```javascript
  const someChoices = ["üíé"];
  console.log(`Original ‚ÄòsomeChoices‚Äô: ${someChoices}`);
  someChoices.push("üìÑ");
  console.log(`‚ÄòsomeChoices‚Äô after ‚Äòpush()‚Äô: ${someChoices}`);
  const allChoices = [...someChoices, "‚úÇÔ∏è"];
  console.log(`‚ÄòsomeChoices‚Äô after creating ‚ÄòallChoices‚Äô: ${someChoices}`);
  console.log(`And ‚ÄòallChoices‚Äô itself: ${allChoices}`);
  ```

- `push()` is mutating, while `[...someChoices, "‚úÇÔ∏è"]` is performing a functional update.

- Why is immutability good?

## Avoid Side-Effects

For example:

```javascript
class Rock {}
class Paper {}
class Scissors {}

function beats(thisPlayerChoice, otherPlayerChoice) {
  if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Rock)
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors;
  if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Paper)
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Rock;
  if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors)
    return otherPlayerChoice instanceof Paper;
}

let beaten = false;
function beatsViaSideEffects(thisPlayerChoice, otherPlayerChoice) {
  if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Rock)
    beaten = otherPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors;
  else if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Paper)
    beaten = otherPlayerChoice instanceof Rock;
  else if (thisPlayerChoice instanceof Scissors)
    beaten = otherPlayerChoice instanceof Paper;
}
```

- Why is `beatsViaSideEffects()` worse than `beats()`?

- So mutation is an example of side-effects. What are other examples?

- When are side-effects bad? When are they desired?

## Idempotence

- If side-effects are inevitable, try to make functions safe to run multiple times, that is, make them _idempotent_.

- For example, [see how we use `IF NOT EXISTS` when creating a table on the database](https://github.com/jhu-oose/todoose/blob/1608e75189822bd36b5b86d1f4f43830bb935b76/src/main/java/com/jhuoose/todoose/repositories/ItemsRepository.java#L16).

- Why is this a good idea?

# Other Paradigms

Different programming paradigms exist to help you communicate different ideas more expressively. My favorite uncommon paradigm is [relational programming](https://codon.com/hello-declarative-world).
