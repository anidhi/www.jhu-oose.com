# Opportunities for Extra Points

**Contribute to an Open-Source Project:** The contribution may be something as simple as fixing a typo on the `README.md` or as sophisticated as a new feature. Your contribution doesnâ€™t have to be accepted by the maintainers, though itâ€™s better if it is. Weâ€™ll evaluate your contribution and award extra points accordingly. If youâ€™re looking for an open-source project to contribute to, we recommend the [the courseâ€™s projects](https://github.com/jhu-oose) (including the website youâ€™re reading right now), and the tools in the [Toolbox](/toolbox), most of which are open-source. [Javalin](/toolbox#web-server-javalin) is particularly welcoming to new contributors, and [we have contributed to it already](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin/commits?author=leafac). Submit your open-source contribution to our consideration by opening an issue on your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.

**Participate in a Forum:** This may be either the forum in the [Students Area](https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-students){:data-proofer-ignore="true"}Â <small title="You must a student logged into GitHub to see this.">ðŸ”’</small> or forums such as [StackÂ Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and mailing lists for open-source projectsâ€”just donâ€™t ask questions about [individual assignments](/#individual-assignments) in these public spaces. Weâ€™ll evaluate your participation and youâ€™ll be award extra points for particularly [insightful and well-crafted](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) questions and answers. Submit your outstanding contribution in a forum to our consideration by opening an issue on your personal repository at `https://github.com/jhu-oose/{{site.course}}-student-<identifier>`.
