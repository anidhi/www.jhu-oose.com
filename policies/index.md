# Policies

# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct), in which the “project” is the course, the “project maintainers” are the course staff, and the “contributors” are the students. Violations must be reported to <code-of-conduct@jhu-oose.com>.

# Academic Integrity

We follow the [Academic Integrity Code by the Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-integrity-code/).

# Grades

|                          | % of Final Grade |
| ------------------------ | :--------------: |
| Individual Assignments   |        25        |
| Quiz                     |        15        |
| Group Project Iterations |        25        |
| Group Project            |        35        |

Individual assignments and group project iterations are weighted equally. For example, if there are 11 assignments throughout the semester, then each assignment contributes to 25% ÷ 11 = 2.27% of the final grade.

Generally the grades for group project iterations and the final grade for group project are the same for all group members, but we may adjust grades for members with outstanding contributions or outstanding bad behavior.

# Late Days

**Individual Assignments:** You have ten late days to use throughout the semester. You may use late days only during the [Late Days periods](/calendar). Late days are indivisible, for example, a submission that is one hour late counts as one late day. We don’t accept submissions after the Late Days periods or when more than ten late days have been used.

**Group Projects:** There is no late day policy. If you are unable to contribute to an iteration, you must make arrangements with your group advisor and other group members.

# Differences Between EN.601.421 (Undergraduate Students) and EN.601.621 (Graduate Students)

Some tasks that are extra credit for students in EN.601.421 may be required for students in EN.601.621, and group projects by students in EN.601.621 are held to a higher standard.
