# Prior Art

Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) was a course created and taught by [Dr. Scott Smith](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/) for many years. [This was his website for the course as of the last time he taught it, in 2018](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose/index.shtml). Of course, it was the primary inspiration for the website you’re reading now.

One of Dr. Scott’s students, [Dr. Zachary Palmer](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/), taught in 2017 at Swarthmore College a course similar to OOSE, which he called simply [Software Engineering](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~zpalmer/cs71/f17/). We also borrowed from the changes he introduced to the course.
